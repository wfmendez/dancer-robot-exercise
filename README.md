Welcome to the Dancer Robot Exercise! ðŸ‘‹ This project is a fun, hands-on exercise crafted using HTML and CSS to explore the power of CSS transformations and transitions. My main goal was to bring a simple robot figure to life by making its parts move and animate on user interaction.

This exercise was a fantastic way to grasp how CSS can be used not just for styling, but for adding dynamic and interactive elements to web pages!

Project Goal & What You'll See ðŸ’¡
The core idea behind this project was to practice:

- HTML Structure: Building a basic, semantically organized robot figure using div elements.
- CSS Styling: Applying colors, shapes, and positioning to create the robot's appearance.
- CSS Transformations: Utilizing properties like transform: rotate() to make the robot's limbs and head move.
- CSS Transitions: Smoothing out these movements with transition properties, making the animations fluid and appealing when you hover over different parts.

When you open this project, you'll see a friendly robot. Try hovering your mouse over its head, arms, and legs to see it perform some simple dance moves! ðŸ˜‰

Key Technologies Used ðŸ’»
This exercise primarily focuses on the fundamentals of:

- HTML: For laying out the robot's body parts.
- CSS: For all the styling, shaping, positioning, and especially for adding the interactive movements with transform and transition properties.
